# Interactive KQL Query Store

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)]()

Currently many KQL queries are published on GitHub by Microsoft and Security Community on GitHub. All the queries are scattered as unstructured data and disorganized in various places making it difficult to discover for defenders and detection authors. 

GitHub search interface is not flexible to satisfy various custom search needs for defenders to effectively search various KQL queries by datasource , KQL operators , parsing of complex fields in data sources, custom tags if available etc. Having it easy to discover will help defenders in referencing existing work while writing new queries, reuse complex parsing examples in specific data sources and much more. 

## Project Goals

- Organized data store of KQL queries as a structured data store
- Easy discoverability of KQL Queries based on tags, KQL operators, Datasource etc. 
- Point to relevant sources and GitHub links. 
- Interactive dashboard to explore the structured data.
- Insights on various KQL queries from Azure Sentinel
